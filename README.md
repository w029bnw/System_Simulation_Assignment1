# System_Simulation_Assignment1
This is the first assignment for Dr. Mateen Rizki's System and Simulation course at Wright State University.

This project instructed students to simulate a drive-thru station with two order windows in Simpy and then to simulate
the same drive-thru with two human servers instead and compare results.
